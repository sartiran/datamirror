Scripts used to mirror data from LLR to CERN.  

These are old scripts written in a hurry. There are many better,
easier to manage and more performing ways to transfer files between
two sites (for example today I would use fts3). The only reason why I
still use these script is that we do not have time to improve them and
that, afterall, they do the job.
